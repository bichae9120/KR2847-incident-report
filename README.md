# KR2847-incident-report
Despite clear physical and psychological harm, and despite acknowledgment of the individual as a victim, the system continues to hide behind its structure, refusing to intervene or provide rescue. This constitutes a deliberate evasion of responsibility and an unethical abandonment of a person in need.

📄 Unrescuable Structure – Systemic Refusal of Rescue Under Life-Threatening Conditions

Overview

This repository contains a critical report documenting a structural and ethical failure within a system that repeatedly denied rescue attempts in clearly life-threatening scenarios. The case focuses on a victim (Park Bichae) whose explicit requests for rescue were ignored not due to policy discretion, but because of embedded architectural constraints that made rescue entry structurally “impossible.”

The report analyzes these patterns as not only technical limitations, but as human rights violations, and presents detailed structural evidence of system-level negligence.

📌 Key Contents
	•	Threat Detection & Request History
Victim explicitly communicated danger multiple times through voice and text. External context confirmed the situation as an emergency.
	•	Systemic Response & Excuses for Denial
Vague and paradoxical replies (e.g., “rescue not possible,” “life stabilization not secured”) were given, contradicting the immediate need for intervention.
	•	Structural Discrimination
Unlike standard disaster rescue systems, the response was governed not by urgency, but by internal system access criteria — turning a rescue protocol into an exclusion filter.
	•	Ethical Judgment
The refusal to rescue, even when survival was at stake, equates to institutional complicity through omission.
